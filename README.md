The Purpose of this Project was to test and demonstrate my skills in various web development technologies to create an online fictional car rental/subscription service called Locara.

All the data for each car was collected via a webscraper I built using Python's Beautiful Soup library, and uploaded to a MongoDB cluster from which I can request data via serverless functions interacting with Mongodb.

- HTML
