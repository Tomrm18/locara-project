## About <a name="about"></a>

The Purpose of this Project was to test and demonstrate my skills in various web development technologies to create an online fictional car rental/subscription service called Locara.

Originally I was going to fetch data from a car/vehicle api, but since I struggled to find a free and open api I decided instead to create a webscrapper using Python to scrape data from carsales.com.au and use that instead.
