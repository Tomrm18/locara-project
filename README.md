## About <a name="about"></a>

The Purpose of this Project was to test and demonstrate my skills in various web development technologies to create an online fictional car rental/subscription service called Locara.

All the data for each car was collected via a webscraper I built using Python's Beautiful Soup library, and uploaded to a MongoDB cluster from which I can request data via my Node/Express backend.

Technologies used in this project:

- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- MongoDB
- Git & Github

Libraries/Modules used in this project

- React
- Next JS
- Node JS
- Express
- React Icons
- Typed.js
- TS Particles

## Installation <a name="install"></a>
Note you will not be able to connect to the backend as the MongoDB cluster info is not comitted to this repo for privacy/security reasons. In order to query and view cars please use the deployed vercel <a href="https://locara-project-serverless.vercel.app/">webapp</a> instead.

```
git clone <project ssh recommended>
cd locara-project
npm install
npm run install-dev
```
